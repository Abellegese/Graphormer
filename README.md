Introducing a groundbreaking drug design library at the forefront of innovation, leveraging the power of graph transformers. 
This cutting-edge network, intricately designed, predicts drug compounds based on protein structures. 
Bridging the realms of computational biology and artificial intelligence, our library pioneers a transformative approach to drug discovery. J
oin us in reshaping the landscape of pharmaceutical research with a tool that unlocks the potential of graph transformers for accurate and efficient drug design based on protein structures.
